### 1. Approach for the Project
This will include:

The project's objectives based on the files.
Architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, microservices) and dependencies (as seen in go.mod and go.sum).
How various components interact, e.g., handlers, repositories, services, and tests.
### 2. Understanding the Project
This will reflect:

The purpose of each file.
The problem the project solves.
How the components work together to address the problem.
### 3. Solution for the Project
This will focus on:

### Implementation details.
How specific modules contribute to the overall solution.
Explanation of testing strategy and deployment setup.
Let me process the files and extract details to craft this overview. Please hold on. ok ra cuh?

## 1. Approach for the Project
# Objective:
The project aims to build a comprehensive product management system. Key functionalities include:

## CRUD Operations for products.
Image Processing with integration to RabbitMQ for task queuing.
Caching with Redis for faster product retrieval.
Database Management using PostgreSQL.
Logging and Error Handling for operational robustness.
## Architecture:
Layered Architecture:

Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses (product_handler.go).
Service Layer: Implements business logic (product_service.go).
Data Layer: Interacts with the database (product_repository.go).
Utility Layer: Includes logging, validation, and Redis cache handling.
Tech Stack:

Backend: Golang.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Caching: Redis.
Task Queue: RabbitMQ.
Testing: Testify framework.
Environment Management: Dotenv.
Integration Points:
RabbitMQ: Manages image processing tasks asynchronously.
Redis: Caches product details for faster access.
PostgreSQL: Stores user and product data persistently.
## 2. Understanding the Project
Key Components:
Database Management:

Tables for users and products are defined in migrations.sql.
Products include details like images and prices.
Image Processing:

Uses RabbitMQ for queueing and image_processor.go for processing.
Processes images (e.g., compressing) and updates the database.
Redis Cache:

Improves performance by caching frequently accessed product details.
Error Handling & Logging:

Provides structured logs (logger.go) and retry mechanisms (error_handler.go).
HTTP Endpoints:

Defined in main.go and handled by product_handler.go for CRUD operations.
Workflow:
A product is created using an API endpoint.
Product details are stored in PostgreSQL.
Image URLs are added to a RabbitMQ queue for processing.
Processed images are saved in S3 (simulated here) and updated in the database.
Cached details in Redis are updated for quick retrieval.
## 3. Solution for the Project
Implementation Details:
Create Product:

POST /products endpoint to create new products.
Validates input and saves product data in PostgreSQL.
Fetch Product:

GET /products/{id} fetches a single product by ID.
First checks Redis; if not found, retrieves from PostgreSQL.
Image Processing:

RabbitMQ consumes tasks from the queue.
Simulates image compression and updates the database.
Testing Strategy:

Unit tests validate repository, cache, and API layers (_test.go files).
Mocks used for database and cache interactions.
Key Modules:
product_handler.go: API endpoints.
product_repository.go: Database interaction.
redis_cache.go: Caching logic.
image_processor.go: Handles RabbitMQ tasks.
Deployment:
Deploy RabbitMQ, Redis, and PostgreSQL in Docker containers.
Run the Go application, ensuring environment variables are configured.
